## Basic installation

You can install this package via composer using:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-backup
```

The package will automatically register its service provider.

To publish the config file to `config/backup.php` run:

``` bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Backup\BackupServiceProvider" --tag=backup-config
```

You can also publish translation files using the command:


``` bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Backup\BackupServiceProvider" --tag=backup-translations
```


This is the default contents of the configuration:

```php

## Configuring the backup disk

By default, the backup will be saved into the `storage/app/Laravel/` directory of your laravel application.
We recommend that you create a disk named `backups` (you can use any name you prefer) in `filesystems.php` and specify that name in the `disk` key of the `backup.php` config file.

## Scheduling

After you have performed the basic installation you can start using the `backup:run`, `backup:clean`, `backup:list` and `backup:monitor`-commands. In most cases you'll want to schedule these commands so you don't have to manually run `backup:run` everytime you need a new backup.

The commands can be scheduled in Laravel's console kernel, just like any other command.

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('backup:clean')->daily()->at('01:00');
   $schedule->command('backup:run')->daily()->at('01:30');
}
```

Or for Laravel 11 or higher you just add them to the console routes file.
```php
// routes/console.php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('backup:clean')->daily()->at('01:00');
Schedule::command('backup:run')->daily()->at('01:30');
```

Of course, the times used in the code above are just examples. Adjust them to suit your own preferences. It is generally a good idea to avoid the timeslot between 02:00 and 03:00 at night in areas where daylight saving time changes occur, as this causes sometimes a double backup or (worse) no backup at all.

If a backup cannot be taken successfully, the `backup:run` command returns an exit code of 1 which signals a general error, so you can use laravel's task hooks to specify code to be executed if the scheduled backup succeeds or fails:

```
   $schedule
      ->command('backup:run')->daily()->at('01:00')
      ->onFailure(function () {
         ...
      })
      ->onSuccess(function () {
         ...
      });
```

## Monitoring

If your application is broken, the scheduled jobs cannot run anymore. You might also simply forget to add a cron job needed to trigger Laravel's scheduling. In either case, you may think backups are being made when in fact nothing is being backed up.

To find out about problems with your backups, the package ships with monitoring functionality. It will inform you when backups become too old or when they take up too much storage.

Learn how to [set up monitoring](/docs/laravel-backup/v8/monitoring-the-health-of-all-backups/overview).

## Dumping the database
`mysqldump` is used to backup MySQL databases. `pg_dump` is used to dump PostgreSQL databases. If these binaries are not installed in a default location, you can add a key named `dump.dump_binary_path` in Laravel's own `database.php` config file. **Only fill in the path to the binary**. Do not include the name of the binary itself.

If your database dump takes a long time, you might exceed the default timeout of 60 seconds. You can set a higher (or lower) limit by providing a `dump.timeout` config key which specifies, in seconds, how long the command may run.

Here's an example for MySQL:

```php
//config/database.php
'connections' => [
	'mysql' => [
		'driver'    => 'mysql'
		...,
		'dump' => [
		   'dump_binary_path' => '/path/to/the/binary', // only the path, so without `mysqldump` or `pg_dump`
		   'use_single_transaction',
		   'timeout' => 60 * 5, // 5 minute timeout
		   'exclude_tables' => ['table1', 'table2'],
		   'add_extra_option' => '--optionname=optionvalue', // for example '--column-statistics=0'
		]
	],
```

## SkipSsl in MySQL/MariaDB database connection
set the value of `dump.skip_ssl` to `true`  in your `config/database.php` to bypass **`TLS/SSL error: self-signed certificate`** error while establishing a database connection

Here's an example for MySQL:

```php
//config/database.php
'connections' => [
	'mysql' => [
		'driver'    => 'mysql'
		...,
		'dump' => [
                    'dump_binary_path' => '/path/to/the/binary', // only the path, so without `mysqldump` or `pg_dump`
                    'skip_ssl' => true, // default value is `false`
		   ...,
		]
	],
```

### Timestamp form of database dumps

By default, database dump filenames do not contain a timestamp. If you would like to add a timestamp, you can set the timestamp format to be used in the config.

For example, to save a database dump with a timestamp in the format of Y-m-d-H-i-s:
```php
//config/backup.php
'backup' => [
    ...,
    'database_dump_file_timestamp_format' => 'Y-m-d-H-i-s',
  ],
```

> This relates to the names of the database dump files **within** the overall backup `zip` file that is generated.

### Base name of database dumps

By default, database dump filenames use the database name. If you would like to name dump files with the connection name, you can set that in the config.

For example, to save a database dump using the connection name in the filename:
```php
//config/backup.php
'backup' => [
    ...,
    'database_dump_filename_base' => 'connection',
  ],
```

> This relates to the names of the database dump files **within** the overall backup `zip` file that is generated.

### File extensions of database dumps

By default, database dump files are named `.sql`, except for the MongoDB driver which are named `.archive`. If you would like to override this, you can set the file extension to be used in the config.

For example, to save a database dump as a `.txt` file:
```php
//config/backup.php
'backup' => [
    ...,
    'database_dump_file_extension' => 'txt',
  ],
```

> This relates to the names of the database dump files **within** the overall backup `zip` file that is generated.

### Custom database dumpers

If you need to have a custom database dumper for a driver, you can use `DbDumpFactory::extend()`. It expects the first argument to be the driver name and the second to be a callback that returns an instance of `Spatie\DbDumper\DbDumper`.

```php
DbDumperFactory::extend('mysql', function() {
    return new YourCustomMysqlDumper();
});
```

```php
use Spatie\DbDumper\DbDumper;

class YourCustomMysqlDumper extends DbDumper
{

}
```
